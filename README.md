# auto-meet

This project is a Python-based solution to activities that took a long time to complete at my previous workplace. It automates the generation of cards in Trello for general meetings, but it may also be used to generate hundreds of cards in minutes.

The solution is based on the Trello API and the graphical interface was built using PyQt.
